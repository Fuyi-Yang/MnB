I created an application that automates user registration data from the signup website and organizes performances based on submitted availability, shortening hours of manual labor to just a few seconds of computer program execution, for the non-profit MusicNBrain.
The program can dynamically output the programs based on sessions in separate Google Sheets tabs, including a total count of participants and easy-to-read formatting.
